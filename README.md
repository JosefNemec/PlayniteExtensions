Contributions

Regarding code styling, there are only a few major rules:

- private fields and properties should use camelCase (without underscore)
- all methods (private and public) should use PascalCase
- use spaces instead of tabs with 4 spaces width
- always encapsulate the code body after *if, for, foreach, while* etc. with curly braces:

```csharp
if (true)
{
    DoSomething()
}
```

instead of

```csharp
if (true)
    DoSomething()
```
